# Vision-360

## Project background / Contexte du projet
This client is vlogger but currently had no way of independently adjusting her camera or even starting it, so always needs help to do that. They take videos of themselves and of things around them for the vlog. They currently use 2 different cameras: Sony ZV1 and Canon SX730HS. Here is their vlog:

Your task is to design a system that can rotate a camera 360 deg and can activate the ON/OFF and START/STOP buttons on the camera. It must be activated and controlled by using both bluetooth (BLE)  (which will later get connected to the head array of the client's wheelchair) and by a wired hand activated switch. It needs to be mounted securely to the wheelchair. It should be adaptable for different types of cameras. Ideally the height of the camera can be adjusted as well. Considerations for using the device while moving in the wheelchair must be taken into account.
